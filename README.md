# Instacart-masket-basket-analysis

In this GitHub repository I have shared the code that I used to come up with a private f1 score of 0.38459 for Instacart Market Basket Analysis Challenge launched by Kaggle. This repository contains END-END solution of the problem starting from EDA, Feature Engineering to Deployment in GCP. Please go through sample input and output screenshots provided to get an idea of how the deployed application looks. Most of the techniques of EDA and feature engineering and modelling are thoroughly discuused in the blog https://suniljammalamadaka.medium.com/
